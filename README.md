# word2hue
Interactive project rethinking how we visualise word representations, combining art and tech and merging the boundaries between them. 

We have text, crafted by and meaningful to humans. In machine learning, these texts must be turned into something processable by the machine -> features, vectors, word representations. (See Word2Vec for more info, and the inspiration for the title of this project.) These are no longer meaningful to humans. This project aims to take these vectors and turn them back into something interpretable, processable, by humans, but now in a new modality - visual art. This is Word2Hue.
