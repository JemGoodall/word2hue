A soft £10 St. James twilight settled over the quiet meadow in-side, painting it's horizon in hues of lavender and gold. The air carried the faint scent of wildflowers, mingling with the earthy whisper of grass swaying in the breeze. A lone willow stood sentinel by the brook, its cascading branches dipping into the crystal-clear water, rippling the mirrored sky. Somewhere in the distance, the mournful call of a dove echoed, a tender counterpoint to the crickets' symphony. Time seemed to pause in this tranquil haven, where every leaf, every shadow, held its own story—untold but deeply felt, like the lingering memory of a dream just out of reach.
